# Claude Code Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **"Coming Soon" Pages**: Claude Code was generating placeholder pages instead of complete websites
2. **Incomplete Todo Lists**: Only 1-2 tasks were being completed before generation stopped
3. **Low Quality Output**: Results were not professional or aesthetically pleasing
4. **Early Termination**: Claude Code was stopping before completing all tasks

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Enhanced System Prompts** (`src/services/claude-code/prompts.ts`)

#### Before:
- Generic instructions about creating "professional websites"

#### After:
- **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS** section added:
  - NEVER create "coming soon" pages or placeholder content
  - ALWAYS complete ALL tasks in todo list
  - ALWAYS generate FULL, FUNCTIONAL websites
  - Continue working until ENTIRE website is complete
- **MANDATORY COMPLETION CHECKLIST** added with specific items to verify
- Explicit "NEVER" rules including:
  - Never stop before completing all tasks
  - Never use lorem ipsum or dummy text
  - Never leave sections empty

### 2. **Increased Processing Capacity**

#### `src/services/claude-code/service.ts`:
- **maxTurns**: Increased from 10 → 50
- **allowed_tools**: Added "RunCommand" for more capabilities

#### `src/app/api/chat-claude-code/route.ts`:
- **maxTurns**: Increased from 10 → 50

### 3. **Prompt Enhancement** (`src/services/claude-code/index.ts`)

Enhanced user prompts automatically with:
```
CRITICAL: Create a COMPLETE, PROFESSIONAL website with:
- Full homepage with hero, features, testimonials, CTA sections
- Real, compelling content (NO placeholders or lorem ipsum)
- Premium design that looks expensive
- All requested features fully implemented
- Complete the ENTIRE website before stopping
```

### 4. **Diagnostic System** (`src/services/claude-code/diagnostic.ts`)

Added comprehensive logging to track:
- Todo list creation and size
- Task completion progress
- Completion rate calculation
- Warnings when tasks are incomplete

### 5. **Fixed Standard System Message** (`src/lib/system.ts`)

#### Before:
- Instructed to "change the home page to a placeholder"

#### After:
- Build a complete, professional homepage with all sections
- NEVER create "coming soon" pages or placeholders

## Verification Steps

### 1. **Check Environment Variable**
Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_CLAUDE_CODE=true` is set in Vercel

### 2. **Monitor Browser Console**
Should see: `[Chat] Using API route: /api/chat-claude-code, Claude Code enabled: true`

### 3. **Watch Vercel Function Logs**
Look for:
- `[Claude Code] Starting new website generation...`
- `[Claude Code] Created todo list with X tasks`
- `[Claude Code] Progress: X/Y tasks completed`
- `[Claude Code] SUCCESS: All X tasks completed!`

## Expected Improvements

1. **Complete Websites**: Full professional sites, not placeholders
2. **Task Completion**: 100% of todo items completed
3. **Professional Quality**: Premium, expensive-looking designs
4. **Real Content**: No lorem ipsum or dummy text
5. **All Features**: Every requested feature implemented
