# Claude Code Preview Fix Summary

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **File Operations Were Not Being Executed** ❌ → ✅

#### Problem:
- MCP Bridge was returning simulated results: `return { success: true, operation: edit.operation, path: edit.path }`
- Stream Adapter had comment: `// Here we would actually execute the file operation via MCP - For now, we'll simulate it`
- **Files were never actually created in the Freestyle sandbox!**

#### Fix:
- Updated `mcp-bridge.ts` to actually execute tool operations through MCP
- Updated `streaming.ts` to use the MCP Bridge for real file operations
- Added proper logging to track file operations

### 2. **Path Issues** ❌ → ✅

#### Problem:
- Error in chat: `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir '/template/template'`
- Claude Code was using `/template` prefix incorrectly
- Double path issues causing file operations to fail

#### Fix:
- Updated prompts to use root directory `/` instead of `/template`
- Fixed path handling in streaming adapter to remove `/template/` prefix
- Added clear path instructions in system prompt

### 3. **Toolsets Not Being Passed** ❌ → ✅

#### Problem:
- Stream adapter wasn't receiving toolsets needed for file operations
- MCP Bridge couldn't execute operations without toolsets

#### Fix:
- Updated `ClaudeCodeManager.generateWebsite()` to accept toolsets parameter
- Pass toolsets from route to stream adapter
- Properly initialize MCP Bridge with toolsets

### 4. **"Please Continue" Creating New Todo Lists** ❌ → ✅

#### Problem:
- When user said "please continue", Claude Code started over with a new todo list
- Previous progress was lost

#### Fix:
- Added CONTINUATION RULES to system prompt
- Clear instructions to continue existing todo list, not create new one

## Verification Checklist

### In Vercel Function Logs, You Should Now See:

```
[Claude Code Route] Request received - Using Claude Code for premium website generation!
[Claude Code Route] Website request: { type: 'new', style: 'modern', features: [...], pages: [...] }
[MCP Bridge] Writing file: app/page.tsx
[Stream Adapter] Executing create for file: app/page.tsx
[Stream Adapter] File operation successful: app/page.tsx
[MCP Bridge] Writing file: components/navigation.tsx
[Stream Adapter] File operation successful: components/navigation.tsx
...
```

### What Should Happen Now:

1. **Files Actually Created**: Real files written to Freestyle sandbox
2. **Preview Updates**: As files are created, preview should update
3. **Proper Paths**: Files created in correct locations (app/, components/, etc.)
4. **Continuation Works**: "Please continue" resumes work, doesn't restart

## Key Changes Summary

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| MCP Bridge | Simulated operations | Real tool execution |
| Stream Adapter | Simulated file writes | Actual MCP operations |
| Path Handling | /template/app/page.tsx | app/page.tsx |
| Toolsets | Not passed to adapter | Properly passed through |
| Continuation | Created new todo list | Continues existing work |

## Testing the Fix

1. Submit a prompt like: "Create a modern SaaS landing page"
2. Watch Vercel logs for file operations
3. Preview should update as files are created
4. If it stops, say "please continue" - it should resume, not restart

## Important Notes

- Files are now ACTUALLY being written to the sandbox
- Preview should update automatically as files are created
- If preview doesn't update, try refreshing it
- Monitor Vercel logs to confirm file operations are executing

## If Issues Persist

1. Check Vercel logs for any errors during file operations
2. Verify MCP tools are available (write_file, read_file, etc.)
3. Ensure Freestyle sandbox is properly initialized
4. Check if file paths are correct in the logs
